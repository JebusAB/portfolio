    <h3>About me:</h3>
    <p>I am currently an IT Student in the second year of a "BTS SIO" in the "ORT Lyon" private High-school.
    <br>I prefer Web development (not front-end though, exemplified by how this looks) over mobile/app development and have some knowledge of cybersecurity.
    <br>I am interested in learning more about the use of frameworks in the next few years, as I think they provide a more thorough access to the possibilities of any given programming language.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Here I like to flex my (honestly low-level) skills <p2 class="rainbow">like this</p2> (but i'm still proud, because it's done without Javascript)</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>I also get to tell you about my <a href="skills.php">Skills</a> and <a href="experiences.php">Experiences</a>... <a href="hobbies.php">Hobbies</a> too, I guess.</p>

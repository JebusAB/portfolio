                                    <p>During this internship, I was tasked with creating and improving a page that would show every company device owned by each employee.
                                    <br>For this, I needed to use the Plugin they used to create tables using their database with every equipment in use.
                                    <br>I had to use my knowledge of SQL and PHP to create a page that would use the Plugin with a prepared request to output the table filled with all the informations that are needed.</p>

                                    <p>During this internship, I was tasked with the creation from the ground up of a webpage for a Restaurant, showing the menu and the opening and closing hours.
                                    <br>The directives where to make it easy to modify later, using Wordpress, I also was asked to change the informations about the restaurant that were set up on Google years before and that weren't accurate anymore.
                                    <br>During the creation of the website, I wrote a document, detailing how to modify the "Menu of the Day" page, to ease the use of Wordpress for the person in charge of changing it everyday.
                                    <br>By the time the site was complete, I was tasked with uploading it to a server that sadly wasn't functional anymore, and the internship ended before I could upload what was done after the repairs. I left after giving them the files of the site.</p>

                                    <br>At the root of the project, we had not much for visuals except for the site's Logo, that we were asked to display at least once on each page.
                                    <br>In order to put every piece of code in a common file, we used GitHub, and we organised ourselves using online tools like Trello.
                                    <br>I used my knowledge of some online tools like Figma to build the blueprint of the site, after which I validated it with the "client" (our techer).
                                    <br>After this was validated, I needed to create the site header and the stylesheet that we would use and upgrade during the entire project.</p>

                                    <p>In this personal project, I used my knowledge of PHP and of how to make my own database and server, using MySQL and how to host it.
                                        <br>My objective with this project was to hone down my skills and make something I would like to have and be proud of.
                                        <br>In order to make things easier for this project, I used Laravel as a Framework, mostly due to the ease of making tables and automatically having the rest of the interactions generated.
                                        <br>The Character sheet was the most complex one to make, with the User table being already made in one of the default settings of Laravel, so I had to create every detail that could be made on a Character sheet.
                                        <br>Player info, Bio, character abilities and Stats, all were made pretty easily.
                                        <br>I then made the bulk of the site itself, the main page, listing all the sheets the user had access to, the login & registering pages, and the individual sheet page, showing every information stored for the chosen character sheet.
                                        <br>Then, I took the time to choose the right hosting service for the site, and ported things over pretty easily.
                                        <br>After this, I would say it is one of the projects I have learned from the most, and it is now one of my proudest achievements.</p>
